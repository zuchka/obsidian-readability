# Readability Score

Readability is a small Obsidian plugin. It analyzes all or part of a document using the Flesch Reading Ease (FRE) formula. Your score appears in the status bar. Look for `r9y:` (short for readability) in the status bar.

This began as a fork of [better-word-count](https://github.com/lukeleppan/better-word-count). The idea was to build something smaller, more opinionated, and focused on readability metrics.
