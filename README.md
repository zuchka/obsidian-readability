# Readability Score

Readability is a small Obsidian plugin. It analyzes all or part of a document using the [Flesch Reading Ease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests#Flesch_reading_ease) (FRE) formula. Your score appears in the status bar. Look for `r9y:` (short for readability) in the status bar.

This is a fork of [better-word-count](https://github.com/lukeleppan/better-word-count). The idea was to build something smaller, more opinionated, and focused on readability metrics.
